This notebook only shows how to manage notebooks using `git` and markdown

All notebooks must be stored inside the `notebooks` directory.
During development notebooks are written in their native `ipynb` format, but these files are ignored by `git`.

Before commiting a piece of code in a notebook, go to the root project directory and run


```bash
bash$ make markdown
```

to translate all notebooks to markdown. Then add markdown versions of the notebook to `git`.

After pulling changes from another branch go to the root project directory and run

```bash
bash$ make jupyter
```

to translate markdown versions of notebooks to their native `ipynb` format.
